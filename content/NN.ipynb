        "In recent years there has been an explosion in the amount of available data, due to the extensive availability of low-cost computer memory and automated data collection systems. The regression modeling techniques of the past were developed to work well under ideal theoretical conditions provided basic assumptions are met. In practice however, they typically don't work well with large data sets (observations in the thousands and feature space 50+ dimensions). In the modern era, it is not uncommon to be faced with data sets involving millions of observations and hundreds or thousands of predictors. This exponential growth in available data has motivated researchers in the' fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, and data mining to develop a few brand new procedures for data modeling that can be applied to very large data sets. However, it turns out that flexible, powerful state of the art methods were discovered from theoretical standpoint decades (and even centuries, in the case of Bayesian updating) ago. the missing element has always been the ability of computers to efficiently execute these algorithms in user-friendly ways. The one technique that most exemplifies this narrative is the neural network.\n",

According to lead author, Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan, \"It turns out that, if you take the standard activation functions that people use in practice, and keep increasing the depth of the network, it gives you really terrible performance. We show that if you design with different activation functions, as you get more data, your network will get better and better.\" The article was published in the [Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208779120).\n",

        "CNNs are typically composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. In a convolutional layer, the network \"learns\" to extract features from the input image by convolving it with a set of learned filters. The resulting feature maps capture different aspects of the image, such as edges, corners, and textures. Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps, reducing their dimensionality and making them more computationally efficient. This is typically done by taking the maximum or average value over a local region of the feature map. The formula for max pooling is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$y(i,j) = max { f(i',j') : i' ∈ [istride,istride+p), j' ∈ [jstride,jstride+p) }$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   f is the input feature map\n",
        "\n",
        "-   y is the output pooled feature map\n",
        "\n",
        "-   i and j are the indices of the output feature map\n",
        "\n",
        "-   p is the pooling window size\n",
        "\n",
        "-   stride is the stride of the pooling operation\n",
        "\n",
        " Finally, fully connected layers are used to combine the extracted features and produce the final output. These layers are similar to those used in traditional neural networks, but they operate on the flattened feature maps rather than the raw input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, the weights of the CNN are adjusted using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, similar to traditional neural networks. However, because of the specific structure of CNNs, they can learn to extract high-level features from images and capture complex relationships between them.\n",
